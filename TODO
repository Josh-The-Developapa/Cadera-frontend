goal: hook up frontend to backend
 1. implement login (with jwt) [done]
 2. hook logic for each web component

1. create frontend mapping according to role (set from login)
   - universal logic that ensures no subdomain of the site can be accessed without a valid role state. if null, redirect to login.


(remember to fix Safari cross site cookie bug; host on same domain, or don't use httpOnly cookie)
